Let's go through a **checklist** to ensure your **frontend and backend connection** is properly set up based on all the code we've implemented so far.

---

### **✅ Checklist for Frontend-Backend Connection**
1. **Database Connection (`db.php`)**
   - The database is connected using PDO.
   - Queries use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
   - The connection file is included in all necessary backend files.

2. **Authentication System**
   - `login.php` ✅ Uses AJAX to send login requests.
   - `register.php` ✅ Uses AJAX for user registration.
   - `auth_functions.php` ✅ Handles login, registration, and session management.
   - `logout.php` ✅ Properly clears sessions and redirects users.

3. **User Features**
   - `dashboard.php` ✅ Ensures only logged-in users can access.
   - `profile.php` ✅ Fetches user details securely.
   - `update_profile.php` ✅ Uses AJAX to update user details dynamically.

4. **Class Booking**
   - `class_booking.php` ✅ Uses AJAX to book classes.
   - The class selection dropdown is functional.
   - Bookings are stored in the database.

5. **Payments**
   - `payment.php` ✅ Uses AJAX for payments.
   - Payments are stored in the database.

6. **Admin Panel**
   - `admin_dashboard.php` ✅ Access restricted to admins only.
   - `manage_users.php` ✅ Displays all users with an edit option.
   - `manage_classes.php` ✅ Displays all classes with an edit option.
   - `manage_payments.php` ✅ Displays all payments with an option to delete.

7. **AJAX Integration**
   - AJAX is embedded within login, registration, profile update, class booking, payments, and admin actions.
   - Responses are handled dynamically (e.g., success messages, error messages).
   - Page reloads are prevented unless necessary.

8. **Security Features**
   - **User Authentication**: Only logged-in users can access restricted pages.
   - **Role-based Access**: Admin-only pages restrict normal users.
   - **Input Validation & Sanitization**: `filter_input()` is used to prevent XSS/SQL injection.
   - **Prepared Statements**: Used for all database queries.

### **🔍 What You Should Test**
1. **Login & Registration**
   - Try logging in and registering a new account.
   - Test with incorrect credentials and empty fields.

2. **Profile Update**
   - Try updating user details from the profile page.

3. **Class Booking**
   - Select a class and ensure it gets stored in the database.

4. **Payments**
   - Make a payment and verify it appears in the database.

5. **Admin Functions**
   - Ensure the admin dashboard loads.
   - Test editing users and classes.

### **🔹 Next Steps**
✅ If everything works, I’ll now add **confirmation dialogs before deletions** as requested.  
❌ If any feature isn’t working as expected, let me know what’s not functioning! 🚀
